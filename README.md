# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

There are plenty of times that I wish that I could instantly design a logo. I am great with color schemes and formatting, but sometimes I just need a logo done quick and easy. Thankfully, I created a simple logo generator that can spit out a logo in under a minute. This was my first project that I utilized classes as well as test files. As it was my first time, they were fairly simple and not too complicated to use.

## Installation

You will need to have Node.js installed on your computer to run the logo maker. Then you will need to clone the repository onto your computer. Open up a terminal, navigate to the project, and from there run "npm i" in your terminal. Lastly, run "node index.js" and input all your responses to generate a logo. You can find your sample logo in the folder named examples.

## Tests

There are 6 JavaScript tests that are all found in the lib/tests folder of the application.
There are 2 individual tests for each shape that tests that the text and color is rendered properly.
To run the tests, make sure to have jest installed from npm, then enter "npm run test" in the terminal.
